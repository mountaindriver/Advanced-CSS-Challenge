                <strong>Coding gave me LIFE!!</strong>

                    My dream was always to impact peoples live and improve others well being so no surprise I first went into
                health/wellness.  It seemed appropriate to go and get my BS in Exercise science and completed all the 
                pre-requisites for grad school but I've always been some what of a jack of all trades doing things this 
                and that, creating things and physical therapy didn't let me be very creative or change things up much so
                it didn't feel like the right fit.

                    Every one knows the saying: give a man a fish, feed him for a day, teach a man to fish feed him for
                a life time.  The teacher impacts the student well being directly but the person who impacts both 
                the teacher and the student and every other fisherman is the person creating the fishing poles.  
                The creating of tools and using resources to impact others wellbeing!  I went into coding because
                I could not only impact one person life at a time but many peoples life! It is exciting how much
                change and impact I could have in this information age by what I can create on a computer!
                
                    My specialties and skill rely on my strong ability to learn new skills efficiently, problem solve, and
                design creative new code using a large array of programing languages such as; HTML, CSS, jQuery,
                JavaScript, Python, Git/GitHub/GitLab/GitBash, Responsive Design, Bootstrap, PWA, React.js,
                Client-Server Model API, REST, JSON, AJAX(Fetch API), GraphQL, Heroku, Linting, MySQL, MongoDB, Node.js,
                Express.js, AWS, Java, C#. As the list of new languages and tools keep being created everyday the
                excitement of the possibilities just feel endless!</pre>
